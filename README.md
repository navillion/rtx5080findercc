# RTX 5080 Finder (Canada Computers)
This script will notify you immediately if a RTX 5080 is in stock at Canada Computers

To use, set your desired pickup location (check https://www.canadacomputers.com/en/search?s=5080 and set your Store Pickup location)
and then run RunAvailabilityChecker().

Next, create a Discord webhook and set the WEBHOOK_URL to the link of your webhook so it notifies you. If you want it to ping you on discord, you can copy your discord ID and wrap it like this: <@DISCORD_ID>
